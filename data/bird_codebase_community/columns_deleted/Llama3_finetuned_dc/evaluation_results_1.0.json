This answer explores some consequences of this interpretation.\\\\n\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nFor a team of size $n$ that is awarded $x(n)$ points if it \"wins\" and zero points otherwise, the expectation reduces simply to the probability of winning multiplied by $x(n)$.  With the independent \"fair coin\" model of choosing colors, wherein $n$ black values are found with probability $\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = 2^{-n}$, this expectation equals $x(n)2^{-n}$.  The condition $x(2)=10$ determines **the unique solution**\\\\n\\\\n$$x(n) = 10 \\\\times 2^{n-2}.$$\\\\n\\\\nNotice that this solution has nothing to do with $n$ being random or not.  However, the distribution of team points at the end of the \"competition\" will be strongly determined by the distribution of $n$. To explore this, **we can simulate a competition.**  (The code uses `R`.)\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we specify the number of teams `n.teams`, the number of trials during a competition `n.trials` (which is fixed and equal for all teams in this simulation), and the parameters for a random distribution of team sizes.  In this example, the distribution is Poisson (offset by $1$ to assure positive team sizes) with parameter `lambda`.  We also start the random number generator at a reproducible point.\\\\n\\\\n    lambda <- 3\\\\n    n.trials <- 100\\\\n    n.teams <- 10000\\\\n    set.seed(17)\\\\n\\\\nCreate the teams, assign hat colors to their members for each trial, count up the total number of wins, and award the points accordingly (using the solution $x(n)$):\\\\n\\\\n    n <- 1 + rpois(n.teams, lambda)\\\\n    n.black <- matrix(rbinom(n.trials * n.teams, size=n, p=1/2), nrow=n.teams) == n\\\\n    wins <- apply(n.black, 1, sum)\\\\n    points <- wins * sapply(n, function(n) 10 * 2^(n-2))\\\\n\\\\nHere is a plot of points *versus* team size in this simulation involving 100 trials for each of 10,000 independent teams (averaging `lambda+1` = $4$ people per team).  To make all the data visible, dots on the plot are randomly offset by up to 2.5% of the width and height of the plot.\\\\n\\\\n    jitter <- 0.025\\\\n    xr <- jitter*(range(n) - mean(n))\\\\n    yr <- jitter*(range(points) - mean(points))\\\\n    plot(n + runif(n.teams, xr[1], xr[2]), points + runif(n.teams, yr[1], yr[2]), \\\\n         xlab=\"Team size\", ylab=\"Total points\")\\\\n    abline(coef(lm(points ~ n)), lwd=2, col=\"Blue\", lty=2)\\\\n\\\\n![Plot][1]\\\\n\\\\nThe blue line is the least squares fit to the data.  Its horizontal trend attests to the \"egalitarian\" nature of the solution $x(n)$: the expected number of points is the same regardless of team size.  (In fact, inspecting the least squares fit with `summary(lm(points ~ n))` reveals it has an insignificant--and relatively small--slope.)\\\\n\\\\nPlease notice (a) the extremely skewed distribution of points and (b) the strong tendency for larger teams either to get no points at all or so many points that a single win assures a high standing at the end of the competition. The uniqueness of $x(n)$ shows that  *this behavior is forced on us by the requirements of the problem*.  It nicely illustrates the tradeoff between risk (exhibited as the large ranges of results for larger teams) and reward (apparent as the numbers of points).\\\\n\\\\nIt is instructive to re-run the simulation with different values of the input. When `lambda` grows, for instance, most teams are relatively large, so only a few--and not necessarily the largest--account for almost all the points.\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/EtMBW.png", "", "", "None", "None", "None", "None", "None", "None", "None"], ["None", 2, "None", "64532f6b-b185-4393-8510-3d25fa07af7c", "2014-07-02 17:28:44.0", 105562, 45985, 353908, "Cost for mis-classification can be used as below\\\\n\\\\nfit <- rpart(target ~ .,\\\\ndata=dataset, method=\"class\", parms=list( split=\"information\", loss=matrix(c(0,1,2,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2)), control=rpart.control(usesurrogate=0,maxsurrogate=0))\\\\n\\\\nIn the above example, I have considered that the cost of mis-classifying a -ve observation as 1 unit and cost of mis-classifying a +ve example as +ve as 2 units.", "", "", "None", "None", "None", "None", "None"], ["None", 4, 39597, "7528cb3e-338e-4f2f-aea5-2164e69d1cc7", "2011-07-31 02:37:08.0", 13607, "None", "None", "None", "edited tags; edited title", "", 183, "Can non-random samples be analyzed using standard statistical tests?", "None", "None", "None"], [107915, 2, "None", "ab296b9b-e71d-4140-ace4-9945f4dfccd6", "2012-08-07 02:57:20.0", 33815, "X and Y are not correlated (-.01); however, when I place X in a multiple regression predicting Y, alongside three other (related) variables, X and two other variables are significant predictors of Y.

The distributional properties are not known. Both samples are just a list of numbers. I am interested in a practical R based solution; Of course I could `use y <- expand.grid(A,B)` and `sum(y[,1]>y[,2])/nrow(y)` but this is very computation intensive.\\\\n\\\\nIn practice: In the example data set below I want to compute `Pr(cpe[ID=1]>cpp[ID!=1])`; This means I want to compare every draw from cpe of group 1 with every draw from group 3 and 10 and compute the probability that a draw from `cpe[ID=1]` is greater than a draw from all other groups in cpp, `cpp[ID!=1]`. Since I have to repeat that procedure for each group a solution \u00e0 la expand.grid() is not feasible. If I just draw samples from the joint distributions of 3 and 10 and compare them with the sample of 1 I always get a bias. Can anybody give me a hint how to circumvent this problem, or how to solve this problem in R in a resource saving manner.\\\\n\\\\n    structure(list(id = c(\"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\",
